# Pillager Bot
A Discord bot I wrote around 12/2020 for me and a few friends. 

Pillager Bot makes playing minecraft multiplayer more fun by announcing the coordinates of people when they die. This is especially fun if KeepInventory is off.

The bot in it's current state is build for our specific implementation. If anyone wants to use it, you'll have to create a discord bot [here](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications). After that, change all of the ids (guild, channel, role) to match your server and set the bot to run on your server.

In the future if I come back to this, I'll make everything work with env vars & proper discord guild/channel handling to make this all easier.
